# WASI Preview2 Migration Summary

## Overview
This branch contains the migration from WASI preview1 to preview2 with component model support. The migration involves updating all WASI modules to use the new component model and WIT interfaces.

## Current Status

### Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Updated all WIT interface definitions to use component model
2. ✅ Migrated ante-handler, begin-blocker, end-blocker, and tx-decoder to WASI preview2
3. ✅ Fixed component instantiation and bindings in BaseApp
4. ✅ Updated build system to use cargo-component for WASI modules
5. ✅ Fixed WASI stdout/stderr capture in components
6. ✅ Resolved Event serialization issues between components and host
7. ✅ Fixed profile configuration warnings by moving to workspace level
8. ✅ Fixed WASI component build linking errors by using cargo-component
9. ✅ Restructured module-state injection to use proper WIT interfaces instead of JSON workarounds
10. ✅ Implemented structured event attributes - all events now use proper key-value structures
11. ✅ Added structured validator updates - validator data is now properly typed
12. ✅ Updated all component source code to use new WIT interfaces
13. ✅ Added ModuleStateManager infrastructure for host-side state management
14. ✅ Implemented KVStore resource interface with prefix-based access control
15. ✅ Connected KVStore resources to component linker with WIT bindings
16. ✅ Added comprehensive tests for KVStore prefix isolation and access control
17. ✅ Removed module-state interface completely - replaced with KVStore
18. ✅ Migrated all components (begin-blocker, end-blocker) to use KVStore for state management
19. ✅ Successfully built all WASI components with KVStore-only architecture
20. ✅ Fixed all test failures and updated test infrastructure for KVStore-only architecture
21. ✅ Added comprehensive integration tests for component isolation, persistence, and edge cases

### Remaining Tasks

#### 1. **Module-State Interface** ✅ REMOVED - Replaced with KVStore
**Resolution**: Instead of implementing the complex module-state interface with canonical ABI, we've completely removed it and migrated all components to use KVStore for their state management needs. This simplifies the architecture and avoids the Send+Sync trait issues with WasiCtx.

#### 2. **KVStore Resource Interface** ✅ COMPLETED
**Implementation Details**:
- Implemented prefix-based KVStore access control where each component gets exclusive access to its designated prefix
- Created `PrefixedKVStore` wrapper that enforces prefix isolation
- Implemented `kvstore::Host` and `kvstore::HostStore` traits for ComponentState
- Connected WIT-generated bindings to the KVStore implementation
- Added default prefix mappings:
  - ante-handler: `/ante/`
  - begin-blocker: `/begin/`
  - end-blocker: `/end/`
  - tx-decoder: `/decoder/`

**Testing**: Comprehensive tests verify:
- Components can only access keys within their assigned prefix
- Write isolation between components
- Range queries respect prefix boundaries
- Resource lifecycle management works correctly

#### 3. **Mock Transaction Data** (Low Priority)
**Current Status**: Hard-coded mock data in ante-handler
```rust
fn create_mock_transaction(tx_bytes: &[u8]) -> Transaction {
    // In a real implementation, this would deserialize from protobuf
    Transaction { /* mock data */ }
}
```

**Decision Needed**: Implement real protobuf parsing now, or keep mocks until protobuf migration PR?

#### 4. **Hardcoded Constants** (Low Priority)
**Current Status**: Scattered throughout components
- `min_gas_price = 1u64`
- `inflation_rate = 0.05`
- Various gas costs

**Decision Needed**: Configuration system design - environment variables, config files, or dynamic updates?

#### 5. **Error Handling and State Consistency** (Medium Priority)
**What's Missing**:
- Real validation logic that can fail
- Proper error propagation between components and host
- State rollback mechanisms

#### 6. **Test Infrastructure** ✅ COMPLETED
**Implementation Details**:
- Updated all component tests to remove module-state references
- Rebuilt WASI components with cargo-component to ensure proper exports
- Added comprehensive integration tests:
  - Component isolation: verifies begin-blocker and end-blocker can't access each other's data
  - State persistence: verifies data persists across component invocations
  - Prefix enforcement: verifies components can only access their assigned prefix
  - Edge cases: tests empty values, large keys/values, delete operations, range queries
  - Multiple components: verifies isolation between multiple components with different prefixes
- All tests pass successfully

## Architecture Decisions Resolved

1. ✅ **Module-state removed**: Decided to remove module-state entirely and use KVStore for all state management
2. ✅ **KVStore implemented**: Components now read/write directly to their prefixed KVStore instances
3. ✅ **Migration complete**: All components have been migrated to use KVStore exclusively

## Architecture Decisions Still Needed

1. **Protobuf decision**: Keep transaction mocks for now, or implement real protobuf parsing in this PR?
2. **Test strategy**: How to update tests to work with the new KVStore-only architecture?
3. **Configuration system**: How should components access configuration values currently hardcoded?

## Technical Details

### What Was Removed (JSON Workarounds)
The original implementation had several workarounds that have been cleaned up:

1. **Chain ID JSON Hack**: Components were parsing JSON from the `chain_id` field to get module state
   ```rust
   // OLD - chain_id contained full JSON state
   let additional_data: AdditionalData = serde_json::from_str(&request.chain_id)?;
   
   // NEW - proper module state interface
   let state_data = module_state::get_state();
   ```

2. **Event Attributes as JSON**: Events were JSON strings instead of structured data
   ```rust
   // OLD
   attributes: serde_json::to_string(&[("key", "value")])?
   
   // NEW
   attributes: vec![EventAttribute { key: "key".to_string(), value: "value".to_string() }]
   ```

### Component Structure
- **ante-handler-world**: Handles transaction validation
- **begin-blocker-world**: Handles block initialization  
- **end-blocker-world**: Handles block finalization
- **tx-decoder-world**: Handles transaction decoding
- **module-state**: Provides blockchain state to components
- **kvstore**: Resource-based key-value storage interface

### Build System
- Added cargo-component dependency for building WASI components
- Updated build scripts to use `cargo component build`
- Components are built as .wasm files with embedded component metadata
- All components successfully build and link with proper exports

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **Add proper error handling and validation** - Components need to handle failures gracefully
2. **Implement state serialization** - Complex types (validator updates, proposals) need proper serialization for KVStore
3. **Design configuration system** - Replace hardcoded constants with configurable values
4. **Decide on protobuf vs mock transaction data** - Architectural decision
5. **Add state migration utilities** - Tools to migrate existing state to new KVStore format
