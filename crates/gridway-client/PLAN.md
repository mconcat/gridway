# Gridway Client Architecture

This document details the architectural vision of the Gridway Client crate, which provides client-side infrastructure for interacting with Gridway blockchain nodes. Following the Cosmos SDK client package design, this crate focuses on transaction building, broadcasting, key management, and CLI toolsâ€”making the underlying WASI component architecture transparent to end users.

## Design Philosophy

The client crate serves as the bridge between users and the blockchain, providing familiar interfaces that hide the complexity of the component-based architecture. It maintains strict compatibility with Cosmos SDK standards while offering a superior developer experience through Rust's type safety and modern tooling.

## Core Components

### Client Context

The heart of the client architecture is the context management system, which maintains connection information and configuration for all client operations:

```rust
pub struct ClientContext {
    node_uri: String,
    chain_id: String,
    keyring: Arc<Keyring>,
    broadcast_mode: BroadcastMode,
    gas_adjustment: f64,
    gas_prices: Option<String>,
}

impl ClientContext {
    // Manages the lifecycle of client connections
    pub async fn with_node(&self, f: impl FnOnce(&NodeClient)) -> Result<(), Error> {
        let client = NodeClient::connect(&self.node_uri).await?;
        f(&client);
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

This design ensures that all client operations have consistent configuration and proper resource management.

### Transaction Building

The transaction builder provides a fluent interface for constructing blockchain transactions:

```rust
pub struct TxBuilder {
    client: NodeClient,
    chain_id: String,
    messages: Vec<Any>,
    fee: Option<Fee>,
    memo: String,
    timeout_height: u64,
}

impl TxBuilder {
    pub fn new(client: NodeClient) -> Self { /* ... */ }
    
    pub fn with_messages(mut self, msgs: Vec<Any>) -> Self {
        self.messages = msgs;
        self
    }
    
    pub fn with_fee(mut self, fee: Fee) -> Self {
        self.fee = Some(fee);
        self
    }
    
    pub async fn build_and_sign(&self, signer: &Address) -> Result<Transaction, Error> {
        // Auto-fetch account info
        let account_info = self.client.get_account(signer).await?;
        
        // Build sign doc with proper sequence and account number
        let sign_doc = self.build_sign_doc(account_info)?;
        
        // Sign with keyring
        let signature = self.client.keyring.sign(signer, &sign_doc)?;
        
        Ok(self.assemble_tx(sign_doc, signature))
    }
}
```

Key features:
- **Builder Pattern**: Intuitive transaction construction
- **Auto Account Fetching**: No manual sequence/account number management
- **Gas Estimation**: Automatic or manual gas configuration
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time validation of transaction structure

### Query Infrastructure

The client provides comprehensive query capabilities through both REST and gRPC:

```rust
pub struct QueryClient {
    http_client: reqwest::Client,
    base_url: String,
}

impl QueryClient {
    // ABCI queries for direct state access
    pub async fn abci_query(&self, path: &str, data: Vec<u8>) -> Result<AbciResponse, Error> {
        let response = self.http_client
            .get(&format!("{}/abci_query", self.base_url))
            .query(&[("path", path), ("data", hex::encode(data))])
            .send()
            .await?;
        
        response.json().await
    }
    
    // High-level query methods
    pub async fn get_balance(&self, address: &Address, denom: &str) -> Result<Coin, Error> {
        self.query_module("bank", "Balance", BalanceRequest { address, denom }).await
    }
    
    pub async fn get_account(&self, address: &Address) -> Result<BaseAccount, Error> {
        self.query_module("auth", "Account", AccountRequest { address }).await
    }
}
```

The query infrastructure automatically handles:
- Path construction for different module queries
- Response parsing and type conversion
- Error handling with descriptive messages
- Height-specific queries for historical data

## Command-Line Interface

The CLI provides a comprehensive interface for all blockchain operations:

### CLI Architecture

```rust
use clap::{Parser, Subcommand};

#[derive(Parser)]
#[command(name = "gridway")]
pub struct Cli {
    #[command(subcommand)]
    pub command: Commands,
    
    #[arg(long, global = true)]
    pub node: Option<String>,
    
    #[arg(long, global = true)]
    pub chain_id: Option<String>,
}

#[derive(Subcommand)]
pub enum Commands {
    /// Initialize node configuration
    Init {
        #[arg(long)]
        home: Option<PathBuf>,
    },
    
    /// Key management commands
    Keys(KeyCommands),
    
    /// Transaction commands
    Tx(TxCommands),
    
    /// Query commands  
    Query(QueryCommands),
    
    /// Start the node
    Start {
        #[arg(long)]
        home: Option<PathBuf>,
    },
}
```

Key features:
- **Hierarchical Commands**: Organized by functional area (keys, tx, query)
- **Global Options**: Node URL and chain ID available to all subcommands
- **Configuration Integration**: Reads from config files with CLI overrides
- **Interactive Mode**: Prompts for passwords and confirmations when needed

### Key Management

The CLI integrates with gridway-keyring for secure key operations:

```bash
# Add a new key
gridway keys add alice

# Import existing key
gridway keys import bob --recover

# List all keys
gridway keys list

# Export for backup
gridway keys export alice --unarmored-hex --unsafe
```

### Transaction Operations

Transaction commands follow Cosmos SDK patterns:

```bash
# Send tokens
gridway tx bank send alice cosmos1... 1000uatom --fees 1000uatom

# Sign offline
gridway tx sign tx.json --from alice --offline

# Broadcast pre-signed
gridway tx broadcast signed-tx.json

# Multisig operations
gridway tx multisign tx.json alice bob --offline
```

### Query Operations

Comprehensive query support for all modules:

```bash
# Account queries
gridway query account cosmos1...
gridway query balance cosmos1... uatom

# Transaction queries
gridway query tx <hash>
gridway query txs --events 'transfer.recipient=cosmos1...'

# Block queries
gridway query block <height>
gridway query block-results <height>
```

## Integration with Component Architecture

While the client crate abstracts away the WASI component complexity, it leverages the dynamic service generation provided by the server:

### Dynamic Module Discovery

The client can discover available modules and their operations through the server's API:

```rust
impl Client {
    pub async fn list_modules(&self) -> Result<Vec<ModuleInfo>, Error> {
        // Query server for dynamically generated module endpoints
        let modules = self.query("/gridway/modules/v1/list").await?;
        Ok(modules)
    }
    
    pub async fn get_module_methods(&self, module: &str) -> Result<ModuleMethods, Error> {
        // Discover available queries and transactions for a module
        let methods = self.query(&format!("/gridway/modules/v1/{}/methods", module)).await?;
        Ok(methods)
    }
}
```

This enables:
- **Dynamic CLI Generation**: CLI commands can be built from discovered modules
- **SDK Flexibility**: Client libraries adapt to available modules
- **Backwards Compatibility**: New modules appear automatically in clients

### Configuration Management

The client manages configuration through a layered approach:

```toml
# ~/.gridway/config.toml
[client]
node = "http://localhost:26657"
chain_id = "gridway-1"
broadcast_mode = "sync"

[keyring]
backend = "file"
dir = "~/.gridway/keys"

[gas]
adjustment = 1.5
prices = "0.025uatom"
```

Configuration sources in priority order:
1. Command-line flags
2. Environment variables
3. Configuration file
4. Built-in defaults

## Future Enhancements

### Hardware Wallet Integration

Future support for hardware wallets through standard interfaces:

```rust
trait WalletProvider {
    async fn get_address(&self, path: &DerivationPath) -> Result<Address, Error>;
    async fn sign(&self, path: &DerivationPath, msg: &[u8]) -> Result<Signature, Error>;
}

// Implementations for different hardware wallets
struct LedgerWallet { /* ... */ }
struct TrezorWallet { /* ... */ }
```

### Multi-Language SDKs

While the Rust client provides the foundation, additional SDKs will support broader ecosystem adoption:

- **TypeScript SDK**: For web applications and Node.js
- **Python SDK**: For data analysis and scripting
- **Go SDK**: For projects migrating from Cosmos SDK

Each SDK will maintain the same architectural principles while providing idiomatic interfaces for their respective languages.

## Architectural Principles

The client crate maintains several key principles:

1. **Abstraction**: Hide WASI component complexity from end users
2. **Compatibility**: Maintain Cosmos SDK standards for wallets and tools
3. **Type Safety**: Leverage Rust's type system for correctness
4. **Modularity**: Clear separation between client, CLI, and key management
5. **Discoverability**: Dynamic adaptation to available blockchain modules
