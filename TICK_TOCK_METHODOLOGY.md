# Tick-Tock Development Methodology

## Overview

This document defines the tick-tock development methodology for the Helium project, inspired by Intel's processor design model. This methodology alternates between two distinct development phases to optimize agentic coding effectiveness while maintaining architectural integrity.

## Methodology Structure

### Tick Stage (Implementation Velocity)
**Duration**: ~30 days  
**Focus**: Maximum feature implementation and code density  
**Quality Gate**: All builds and tests MUST pass

#### Objectives
- Maximize parallelized agent development
- Prioritize code volume over clarity
- Add as many features as possible
- Merge changes as fast as possible

#### Agent Behavior
- **Aggressive Implementation**: Focus on getting features working quickly
- **Minimal Documentation**: Only essential comments and docs
- **Fast Iteration**: Prefer working code over perfect code
- **High Parallelization**: Multiple agents working simultaneously

#### Rules and Restrictions
- **STRICTLY PROHIBITED**: Mock implementations, TODOs, or placeholders just to make builds pass
- **REQUIRED**: All code must be fully functional
- **REQUIRED**: All builds and tests must pass
- **REQUIRED**: No broken functionality in production code

#### End Conditions
- Agent efficiency drops below 50% baseline
- Build failure rate exceeds 30%
- Code complexity reaches saturation point
- Time to complete tasks increases exponentially

### Tock Stage (Architectural Refinement)
**Duration**: ~30 days  
**Focus**: Documentation, refactoring, and architectural clarity  
**Quality Gate**: Clean interfaces and comprehensive documentation

#### Objectives
- Write comprehensive documentation
- Perform architectural refactoring
- Improve code hygiene and maintainability
- Reduce complexity while preserving functionality

#### Agent Behavior
- **Rubber-Duck Companion**: Focus on understanding and explaining code
- **Architectural Thinking**: Consider system-wide implications
- **Documentation First**: Prioritize clarity over speed
- **Refactoring Focus**: Improve existing code structure

#### Rules and Permissions
- **PROHIBITED**: Adding new features (except those required for architecture)
- **PERMITTED**: Mock code or TODO function bodies for architectural backbone
- **PERMITTED**: Temporary build failures during refactoring
- **REQUIRED**: Complete documentation for all public interfaces

#### End Conditions
- Documentation coverage >90%
- Interface definitions are clean and complete
- Code complexity reduced by >20%
- Architectural backbone is solid

## Stage Detection and Management

### Automatic Stage Detection

#### Environment Variables
```bash
export HELIUM_DEVELOPMENT_STAGE=tick    # or tock
```

#### Branch Patterns
- `tick/current` - Active tick development
- `tock/current` - Active tock development
- `tick/archive/YYYY-MM` - Historical tick cycles
- `tock/archive/YYYY-MM` - Historical tock cycles

#### Stage Marker File
Create `STAGE_MARKER.md` in repository root:
```markdown
# Current Development Stage

**Stage**: tick  
**Started**: 2024-01-15  
**Expected End**: 2024-02-15  
**Cycle**: 2024-Q1-01  

## Stage Objectives
- Implement user authentication system
- Add transaction processing
- Build REST API endpoints
```

### Stage Transition Criteria

#### Tick → Tock Transition
**Automated Triggers**:
- Agent efficiency metrics drop >50%
- Build failure rate exceeds 30% over 3 days
- Average task completion time increases >3x baseline
- Code complexity metrics reach saturation

**Manual Triggers**:
- All planned features for cycle are implemented
- Technical debt accumulation is too high
- Architecture needs redesign

#### Tock → Tick Transition
**Automated Triggers**:
- Documentation coverage >90%
- All public interfaces documented
- Code complexity reduced >20%
- Architectural refactoring complete

**Manual Triggers**:
- Architecture documentation is complete
- Development team confident in system clarity
- Ready to add new features efficiently

## CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

### Tick Stage CI Pipeline
**File**: `.github/workflows/tick-ci.yml`

**Characteristics**:
- Strict build requirements
- Comprehensive test suite
- Fast feedback loops
- Parallel execution where possible
- No tolerance for build failures

**Quality Gates**:
- All builds must pass
- All tests must pass
- Code coverage maintained
- No TODOs or placeholders allowed

### Tock Stage CI Pipeline
**File**: `.github/workflows/tock-ci.yml`

**Characteristics**:
- Relaxed build requirements during refactoring
- Documentation quality checks
- Architecture compliance validation
- Interface completeness verification

**Quality Gates**:
- Documentation coverage >90%
- All public interfaces documented
- Architecture compliance verified
- Refactoring objectives met

## Agent Guidelines by Stage

### Tick Stage Agent Instructions

#### Command Priority
1. Feature implementation speed
2. Test coverage maintenance
3. Build stability
4. Minimal documentation

#### Merge Strategy
- Fast-forward merges preferred
- Frequent small commits
- Continuous integration
- Minimal review process for working code

#### Code Quality
- Functional code over perfect code
- Performance optimizations later
- Architecture compliance secondary
- Documentation minimal but accurate

### Tock Stage Agent Instructions

#### Command Priority
1. Code understanding and documentation
2. Architectural refactoring
3. Interface clarification
4. System-wide consistency

#### Merge Strategy
- Careful review of architectural changes
- Consolidated commits for major refactors
- Documentation updates with code changes
- Emphasis on system-wide impact

#### Code Quality
- Clarity over speed
- Comprehensive documentation
- Architectural consistency
- Long-term maintainability

## Metrics and Monitoring

### Tick Stage Metrics
- **Velocity**: Features implemented per day
- **Quality**: Build success rate, test pass rate
- **Efficiency**: Agent task completion time
- **Volume**: Lines of code, commits per day

### Tock Stage Metrics
- **Documentation**: Coverage percentage, interface completeness
- **Architecture**: Complexity reduction, dependency clarity
- **Quality**: Code maintainability index, technical debt reduction
- **Clarity**: Interface design quality, system understanding

### Transition Metrics
- **Saturation Points**: When tick efficiency drops
- **Clarity Thresholds**: When tock objectives are met
- **Quality Gates**: Build health, test coverage
- **Cycle Health**: Overall methodology effectiveness

## Implementation Guidelines

### Initial Setup
1. Choose starting stage based on current codebase state
2. Create appropriate branch (`tick/current` or `tock/current`)
3. Set environment variables and stage markers
4. Configure CI pipeline for chosen stage
5. Brief development team on stage-specific guidelines

### Stage Transitions
1. Monitor transition criteria continuously
2. Evaluate readiness for stage change
3. Archive current stage branch
4. Create new stage branch
5. Update CI configuration
6. Update stage markers and documentation

### Continuous Improvement
1. Track methodology effectiveness metrics
2. Adjust stage durations based on project needs
3. Refine transition criteria based on experience
4. Update agent guidelines based on lessons learned

## Success Criteria

### Overall Methodology Success
- Improved agentic coding effectiveness
- Maintained architectural integrity
- Reduced technical debt accumulation
- Faster feature delivery with better quality

### Stage-Specific Success
- **Tick**: High feature velocity with stable builds
- **Tock**: Clear architecture with comprehensive documentation
- **Transitions**: Smooth handoffs between stages
- **Cycles**: Continuous improvement in development efficiency

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Stuck in Tick**: Agents becoming ineffective but not transitioning
- **Stuck in Tock**: Over-documentation without clear completion criteria
- **Transition Friction**: Difficulty switching between stage mindsets
- **Quality Degradation**: Builds failing or tests becoming unreliable

### Resolution Strategies
- **Manual Override**: Allow manual stage transitions when automated criteria fail
- **Hybrid Periods**: Short transitional periods with mixed characteristics
- **Escalation Procedures**: Clear guidelines for when to break methodology rules
- **Feedback Loops**: Regular methodology effectiveness reviews

## Conclusion

The tick-tock methodology provides a structured approach to managing the inherent tension between rapid feature development and architectural clarity in agentic coding projects. By alternating between focused implementation and deliberate refactoring phases, teams can maintain both velocity and quality over time.

The key to success is disciplined adherence to stage-specific guidelines while maintaining flexibility to adapt the methodology based on project-specific needs and lessons learned.
