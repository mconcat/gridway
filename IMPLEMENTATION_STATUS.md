# Helium Implementation Status Report

This document provides an accurate assessment of the implementation status of features claimed in the root PLAN.md as of the current codebase state.

## Claimed Achievements vs Actual Implementation

### 1. WASI Microkernel ❌ **Partially Implemented**

**Claimed**: "Successfully executes ante handlers and transaction processing as WASI modules"

**Actual Status**:
- ✅ Component infrastructure exists (`ComponentHost`, bindings)
- ✅ WASI modules can be executed
- ❌ Ante handlers use old WASI module approach, not components
- ❌ Components are NOT loaded from merkle storage paths
- ❌ Transaction processing doesn't use the component architecture
- ❌ Components are loaded from filesystem, not VFS paths like `/sbin/ante-handler`

**Evidence**: The `WasiAnteHandler` in `baseapp/src/ante.rs` uses raw WASI modules, not the component model described in the architecture.

### 2. Virtual Filesystem ⚠️ **Implemented but Not Connected**

**Claimed**: "State access through file-like operations with capability enforcement"

**Actual Status**:
- ✅ VFS is fully implemented with file-like operations
- ✅ Capability enforcement exists in VFS
- ✅ Path-based access control works
- ❌ VFS is NOT connected to WASI file operations
- ❌ Modules cannot actually use file operations to access state
- ❌ State access happens through direct KVStore bindings instead

**Evidence**: The VFS in `baseapp/src/vfs.rs` is well-implemented but lacks the WASI integration layer that would make it accessible to modules.

### 3. Capability Security ❌ **Not Aligned with Vision**

**Claimed**: "Object-capability model with delegation and revocation"

**Actual Status**:
- ✅ Basic capability system exists
- ❌ NOT integrated with merkle storage (in-memory only)
- ❌ Capabilities lost on restart
- ❌ NOT aligned with filesystem-oriented vision
- ❌ Uses wrong capability types (NetworkCapability, CryptoCapability instead of file descriptors)

**Evidence**: The `capabilities.rs` implementation uses in-memory storage and doesn't follow the file descriptor-based capability model described in PLAN.md.

### 4. JMT Storage ⚠️ **Partially Connected to BaseApp**

**Claimed**: "High-performance Jellyfish Merkle Tree replacing IAVL"

**Actual Status**:
- ✅ JMT implementation exists in helium-store
- ✅ RealJMTStore implemented using Penumbra's ICS23-compatible fork
- ✅ BaseApp now uses JMT through GlobalAppStore
- ✅ GlobalAppStore integration in BaseApp completed
- ✅ Commit() computes actual merkle root hash
- ✅ State persists across restarts (app hash and height)
- ⚠️ VFS still mounts individual stores rather than unified views
- ❌ Prefix iterator not implemented (returns empty)
- ❌ Some error handling silently returns default values

**Evidence**: BaseApp now creates `RealJMTStore` for GlobalAppStore in `baseapp/src/lib.rs:276-282`, and commit() properly computes merkle roots in lines 1224-1276.

### 5. API Compatibility ✅ **Maintained**

**Claimed**: "Full compatibility with existing wallets and tools"

**Actual Status**:
- ✅ gRPC services match Cosmos SDK
- ✅ REST gateway provides compatibility layer
- ✅ Proto definitions from official Cosmos SDK
- ✅ All standard endpoints implemented

**Evidence**: Services in `server/src/grpc/services.rs` and REST gateway in `server/src/rest.rs`.

## Critical Gaps

### 1. Dynamic Component Loading Not Implemented
The revolutionary feature of loading components from merkle storage is not implemented. Components are still loaded from filesystem paths.

### 2. VFS-WASI Integration Missing
The elegant VFS abstraction exists but isn't accessible to WASI modules through file operations as intended.

### 3. Component Model Not Used for Core Functions
While component infrastructure exists, core functions like ante handlers still use the old WASI module approach.

## Accurate Technology Readiness Level

Based on this assessment, the project is at **TRL 4** (Component validation), not TRL 6 as claimed. While individual components exist and some integration has been achieved, critical pieces remain unconnected:

- ✅ State persistence now works (JMT integration completed)
- ✅ App hash computation is functional
- ⚠️ JMT-backed unified store partially implemented (GlobalAppStore works but VFS integration missing)
- ❌ Components still not in merkle tree
- ❌ Capability model still diverges from file descriptor-based design
- ❌ VFS-WASI integration missing

## Recommendations

1. **Priority 1**: ~~Connect BaseApp to GlobalAppStore with JMT backend for state persistence~~ ✅ COMPLETED
2. **Priority 2**: Fix critical JMT issues (app hash timing, prefix iterator, error handling)
3. **Priority 3**: Implement VFS-WASI integration to enable file-based state access
4. **Priority 4**: Redesign capability system to use file descriptors as capability handles
5. **Priority 5**: Implement dynamic component loading from merkle storage paths
6. **Priority 6**: Update documentation to reflect actual implementation status

## Summary

The project has made progress in integrating some components, but key architectural elements remain disconnected:

1. **State Persistence**: ✅ NOW WORKING - JMT integration provides persistent state with proper app hash computation
2. **JMT Connected**: ✅ COMPLETED - BaseApp uses GlobalAppStore backed by RealJMTStore
3. **Wrong Capability Model**: ❌ Still uses traditional capabilities instead of file descriptor-based ocap
4. **Components Not in Merkle Tree**: ❌ WASI components are loaded from filesystem, not merkle storage
5. **VFS Not Connected to WASI**: ❌ Modules cannot use file operations for state access
6. **Critical JMT Issues**: ⚠️ App hash timing, missing prefix iterator, silent error handling

The revolutionary vision of a blockchain where core components live in the merkle tree and can be upgraded through governance remains partially unrealized. However, with JMT integration complete, the project now has a foundation for persistent state management. The next critical steps are fixing JMT issues and connecting the VFS layer to WASI to enable the file-based state access model described in the architecture.
