# Gridway Implementation Status Report

This document provides an accurate assessment of the implementation status of features claimed in the root PLAN.md as of the current codebase state.

## Claimed Achievements vs Actual Implementation

### 1. WASI Microkernel ❌ **Partially Implemented**

**Claimed**: "Successfully executes ante handlers and transaction processing as WASI modules"

**Actual Status**:
- ✅ Component infrastructure exists (`ComponentHost`, bindings)
- ✅ WASI modules can be executed
- ❌ Ante handlers use old WASI module approach, not components
- ❌ Components are NOT loaded from merkle storage paths
- ❌ Transaction processing doesn't use the component architecture
- ❌ Components are loaded from filesystem, not VFS paths like `/sbin/ante-handler`

**Evidence**: The `WasiAnteHandler` in `baseapp/src/ante.rs` uses raw WASI modules, not the component model described in the architecture.

### 2. Virtual Filesystem ⚠️ **Implemented but Not Connected**

**Claimed**: "State access through file-like operations with capability enforcement"

**Actual Status**:
- ✅ VFS is fully implemented with file-like operations
- ✅ Capability enforcement exists in VFS
- ✅ Path-based access control works
- ❌ VFS is NOT connected to WASI file operations
- ❌ Modules cannot actually use file operations to access state
- ❌ State access happens through direct KVStore bindings instead

**Evidence**: The VFS in `baseapp/src/vfs.rs` is well-implemented but lacks the WASI integration layer that would make it accessible to modules.

### 3. Capability Security ❌ **Not Aligned with Vision**

**Claimed**: "Object-capability model with delegation and revocation"

**Actual Status**:
- ✅ Basic capability system exists
- ❌ NOT integrated with merkle storage (in-memory only)
- ❌ Capabilities lost on restart
- ❌ NOT aligned with filesystem-oriented vision
- ❌ Uses wrong capability types (NetworkCapability, CryptoCapability instead of file descriptors)

**Evidence**: The `capabilities.rs` implementation uses in-memory storage and doesn't follow the file descriptor-based capability model described in PLAN.md.

### 4. JMT Storage ❌ **Not Connected to BaseApp**

**Claimed**: "High-performance Jellyfish Merkle Tree replacing IAVL"

**Actual Status**:
- ✅ JMT implementation exists in gridway-store
- ❌ BaseApp uses MemStore instead of JMT
- ❌ No GlobalAppStore integration in BaseApp
- ❌ Commit() returns placeholder hash without merkle computation
- ❌ State is not persistent across restarts

**Evidence**: BaseApp creates `MemStore::new()` instead of using JMT, and the VFS mounts individual MemStores rather than views into a unified GlobalAppStore.

### 5. API Compatibility ✅ **Maintained**

**Claimed**: "Full compatibility with existing wallets and tools"

**Actual Status**:
- ✅ gRPC services match Cosmos SDK
- ✅ REST gateway provides compatibility layer
- ✅ Proto definitions from official Cosmos SDK
- ✅ All standard endpoints implemented

**Evidence**: Services in `server/src/grpc/services.rs` and REST gateway in `server/src/rest.rs`.

## Critical Gaps

### 1. Dynamic Component Loading Not Implemented
The revolutionary feature of loading components from merkle storage is not implemented. Components are still loaded from filesystem paths.

### 2. VFS-WASI Integration Missing
The elegant VFS abstraction exists but isn't accessible to WASI modules through file operations as intended.

### 3. Component Model Not Used for Core Functions
While component infrastructure exists, core functions like ante handlers still use the old WASI module approach.

## Accurate Technology Readiness Level

Based on this assessment, the project is at **TRL 3-4** (Proof of concept / Component validation), not TRL 6 as claimed. While individual components exist, they are not integrated into a persistent, working blockchain system:

- No state persistence (everything is in-memory)
- Core architectural vision (JMT-backed unified store with components in merkle tree) is not implemented
- Capability model diverges from the file descriptor-based design
- The system cannot survive a restart

## Recommendations

1. **Priority 1**: Connect BaseApp to GlobalAppStore with JMT backend for state persistence
2. **Priority 2**: Implement VFS-WASI integration to enable file-based state access
3. **Priority 3**: Redesign capability system to use file descriptors as capability handles
4. **Priority 4**: Implement dynamic component loading from merkle storage paths
5. **Priority 5**: Update documentation to reflect actual implementation status

## Summary

The project has built several isolated components (VFS, capabilities, JMT, WASI execution) but they are not integrated into a coherent system:

1. **No State Persistence**: The entire system uses in-memory stores and cannot persist state
2. **JMT Not Connected**: The JMT implementation exists but BaseApp doesn't use it
3. **Wrong Capability Model**: Implemented traditional capabilities instead of file descriptor-based ocap
4. **Components Not in Merkle Tree**: WASI components are loaded from filesystem, not merkle storage
5. **VFS Not Connected to WASI**: Modules cannot actually use file operations for state access

The revolutionary vision of a blockchain where core components live in the merkle tree and can be upgraded through governance remains unrealized. The current implementation is essentially a WASI execution proof-of-concept without the persistent, capability-secured, VFS-based state management that defines the Gridway architecture.
