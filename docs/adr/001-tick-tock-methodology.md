# ADR-001: Tick-Tock Development Methodology

## Status
Accepted

## Context

AI-assisted development tools like Claude Code have shown remarkable capabilities in generating code at high velocity. However, this rapid development often leads to several challenges:

1. **Code Quality Degradation**: High-velocity code generation can accumulate technical debt quickly
2. **Architectural Drift**: Rapid implementation without periodic reflection leads to inconsistent architecture
3. **Documentation Lag**: Fast-paced development often neglects documentation
4. **Agent Fatigue**: AI agents can exhibit degraded performance when pushing maximum velocity continuously
5. **Human Oversight Gaps**: Autonomous agents working at high speed can miss important architectural decisions

Traditional software development methodologies (Agile, Waterfall, etc.) were designed for human teams and don't adequately address the unique challenges of AI-assisted development.

## Decision

We will implement a **Tick-Tock Development Methodology** that alternates between two distinct phases:

### TICK Phase (Implementation Velocity)
- **Duration**: ~30 days
- **Focus**: Maximum feature implementation speed
- **Quality Gates**: All tests must pass, no broken builds
- **Prohibited**: TODOs, mocks, placeholder implementations
- **Agent Behavior**: Highly autonomous, minimal user interaction
- **Goal**: Ship working features as quickly as possible

### TOCK Phase (Architectural Refinement)
- **Duration**: ~30 days
- **Focus**: Documentation, refactoring, architectural clarity
- **Quality Gates**: Documentation coverage >90%, clean interfaces
- **Permitted**: TODOs for planning, mocks for architectural backbone
- **Agent Behavior**: Conversational, seeks user input frequently
- **Goal**: Improve code quality and system understanding

## Rationale

### Why Alternating Phases?

1. **Sustainable Pace**: Prevents burnout of both AI agents and human reviewers
2. **Quality Balance**: Fast feature delivery balanced with periodic quality improvements
3. **Clear Expectations**: Both humans and agents know what's expected in each phase
4. **Architectural Integrity**: Regular reflection prevents architectural drift
5. **Documentation Rhythm**: Ensures documentation doesn't lag too far behind implementation

### Why 30-Day Cycles?

1. **Long Enough**: Allows meaningful progress in each phase
2. **Short Enough**: Prevents excessive drift or stagnation
3. **Predictable**: Teams can plan around the rhythm
4. **Flexible**: Can be adjusted based on project needs

### Implementation Details

1. **Stage Marker**: `CLAUDE.md` file indicates current stage
2. **CI/CD Enforcement**: Different pipelines for each stage
3. **Automatic Monitoring**: Stage transition recommendations every 6 hours
4. **Clear Guidelines**: Specific rules for agent behavior in each stage

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Higher Quality**: Regular quality improvement phases
2. **Better Documentation**: Dedicated time for documentation
3. **Sustainable Development**: Prevents agent and reviewer fatigue
4. **Clear Expectations**: Everyone knows current priorities
5. **Flexibility**: Can adapt focus based on project phase

### Negative

1. **Learning Curve**: Teams need to understand the methodology
2. **Context Switching**: Moving between phases requires adjustment
3. **Complexity**: More complex than single-mode development
4. **Enforcement Overhead**: Requires CI/CD and monitoring setup

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Clear Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples
2. **Automated Tooling**: Scripts to handle stage transitions
3. **Gradual Adoption**: Teams can start with longer cycles
4. **Feedback Loops**: Regular reviews to adjust the methodology
